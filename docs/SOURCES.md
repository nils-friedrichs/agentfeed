# Upstream sources and their terms

Read on **2026-10-12** for R4. One row per upstream behind a paid route, the MCP rail or a
collector whose data a route sells. Clauses are paraphrased with their numbers; a short
phrase is quoted only where the wording decides the verdict. "Raw" means a route returns the
upstream's own values; "computed" means it returns only metrics we derive.

Verdicts: **clean** (commercial use and redistribution allowed, or attribution only),
**banned** (resale, redistribution or commercial use needs a licence or written consent),
**unclear** (no clause found, or the text is ambiguous for our use).

Rules applied in R4: a banned source that is one of several is dropped and the route kept; a
banned source a route cannot live without, where the route passes its raw values, means the
route is withdrawn (410). Exchange terms (Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, OKX, Gemini, Bybit,
Deribit) changed no route in R4, by the planning chat's steer of 12 Oct: they are recorded
here, R5 moves raw spot and reference prices to on-chain sources, and the planning chat
decides the computed products from the table below.

## R7 (13 Oct 2026): Bybit and Deribit out, Hyperliquid the one perp venue

Planning chat decision R1, executed on the code of origin/main f375f98. **No route reads Bybit or Deribit any more. The one exception is the liquidation tape (C7, below), kept by decision.**

**Withdrawn on 13 Oct 2026 (410 on any method, never charged, `closest_live` in the body; in no manifest, catalogue, tool list or the plugin):**

| route | was | why | closest_live |
|---|---|---|---|
| /api/long-short | Bybit retail account ratio | Bybit API Terms §6.7/§6.9; no clean venue publishes an account ratio | /api/hl-whales, /api/liquidations |
| /api/whale-trades | Bybit trade tape | Bybit §6.7/§6.9; Hyperliquid\'s public API serves its last 10 trades only | /api/hl-whales, /api/liquidations |
| /api/options-summary | Deribit (collector) | Deribit cl. 2.10 / 32.3 name derived data too | /api/volatility |
| /api/options-gex | Deribit (collector) | as above | /api/volatility |
| /api/funding-cross | Bybit and Hyperliquid, with the cross-venue spread | the route was the comparison between venues; one clean venue is left, so it would answer what /api/funding-rate answers. **Taken by the executing session, not named in the planning chat\'s list; reversible** | /api/funding-radar |
| /api/spread-arb | Bybit and Hyperliquid, with the best cross-venue edge | same: with one venue `best_cross` can never exist. **Taken by the executing session; reversible** | /api/basis |

**Single-venue (Hyperliquid) now:** funding-rate, funding-radar, funding-extremes, funding-pulse, funding-history, open-interest, basis, volatility, top-movers, orderbook-imbalance and orderbook-walls (the last two and volatility carried Bybit beside Hyperliquid and were not on the planning chat\'s list; R1\'s sentence covers them), perp, market-state (also without DVOL and without the retail ratio), trade-context, tradfi-radar, equity-24h, positioning.

**Rebuilt on the OI sampler (all three done and tested; none kept its old inputs):**
- the sampler is `bin/hl-oi-collect.js` + `lib/hl-oi.js`: one `metaAndAssetCtxs` call every 5 minutes from root cron (flock, timeout 90, `--max-old-space-size=192`), one row per coin in `hl-oi.db`, 7 days kept; the watchdog reads its newest row (limit 900 s). Hyperliquid publishes the current open interest only, so the record starts on the day the sampler did (first sample 2026-10-13 03:51 UTC).
- **oi-spike-scan** reads it and answers 503 + Retry-After (never billed) until the record is 24 hours deep.
- **squeeze-score**: funding is Hyperliquid\'s; OI build is the 24 h change in the sampler; crowding is the hl-whales net-long share (top 250 accounts by account value, whale crowding, not retail; renamed `whale_net_long_share_pct`); liquidation skew is the tape. 503 until the OI term is warm. A listed coin that none of the top 250 accounts holds returns 200 with a decline naming `whale_net_long_share_pct`.
- **positioning**: Hyperliquid OI (changes from the sampler, null until it reaches back that far) and the whale net-long share, for SOL and BTC.

**funding-radar** covers every Hyperliquid perp: the main dex plus the HIP-3 dexes, each row with its dex and asset class, a 30-day z-score once its history is collected (new perps fill within a few hours). The price stays $0.02.

**wallet-holdings** is off Helius DAS (R7 R3): standard RPC only, see the Helius row. Cost: compressed NFTs are no longer counted (they have no token account).

**503 + Retry-After instead of a 200 that says so (R7 R4), none billed:** liq-pulse, cascade-alert, recent-liquidations, liquidation-stats and liquidation-leaders on a tape older than 30 minutes; funding-pulse, funding-extremes and top-movers on an empty or failed screen; every Hyperliquid route when Hyperliquid cannot be asked (perp included); funding-radar past 15 minutes or in the old snapshot format; peg-deviation and peg-sessions with no sample in the window; exit-quote with no corroborated measurement; cascade-forecast when the model cannot load; market-state when no part of the market picture could be built. A trading decline on a listed symbol stays 200 (squeeze-score).

## R5 Phase C: every route and its venues (12 Oct 2026)

This table supersedes the R4 inventory further down, which is kept as the record of 12 Oct before
R5. It is based on the deployed code.

**Verdicts:**
- **clean:** every upstream is clean, or the route reads chain state.
- **computed:** a banned or unclear upstream feeds the route, but only values we derive are returned.
- **raw-unclear:** the route passes a raw value from an unclear venue.
- **raw-banned:** the route passes a raw value from a banned venue.

"Chain state" means values read from a public chain with standard RPC methods; the RPC provider is only the transport.

### Sources added or changed in Phase C

| Source | Used by | Terms | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Uniswap V3 pools on Ethereum and Base, read with eth_call slot0 through eth.drpc.org and mainnet.base.org (base.drpc.org fallback) | sol/btc/eth-price, price, market-snapshot, trade-context, market-state (BTC, ETH) | Chain state. The RPC terms are already in the table above (Base clean; dRPC clean). | clean |
| Orca Whirlpool and Raydium CLMM pools on Solana, read with getMultipleAccounts | sol-price, price, market-snapshot, trade-context, market-state (SOL); the peg tape's token side | Chain state. The RPC is Helius, used as transport only (Cloud Services Agreement §3.1 allows integration). | clean |
| Solana standard RPC: getAccountInfo, getTokenLargestAccounts, getSignaturesForAddress, getTransaction, getRecentPrioritizationFees, getRecentPerformanceSamples, getEpochInfo | token-metadata, token-risk, token-holders, wallet-activity, priority-fees, jito-tips (via cron), sol-network | Chain state. Replaces DAS getAsset, the enhanced transactions API, getPriorityFeeEstimate and Jito's tip_floor. | clean |
| Hyperliquid info API: metaAndAssetCtxs, perpDexs, l2Book, candleSnapshot, fundingHistory, clearinghouseState | the only venue on every perp route (R7); the OI sampler (bin/hl-oi-collect.js, one metaAndAssetCtxs call every 5 minutes, 7 days kept in hl-oi.db); HYPE spot in market-state (oracle); equity-24h's last regular-session price (HIP-3 hourly candle) | app.hyperliquid.xyz/terms (15 Jun 2026): no data or redistribution restriction | clean |

**Dropped in R6 D2 (13 Oct 2026, planning chat decision (a)):** OKX and Binance venue blocks and rows from funding-rate, funding-cross, funding-radar, open-interest, spread-arb, perp, market-state, tradfi-radar and equity-24h. Both venues remain only in the liquidation tape (C7, kept by decision). The funding radar is now a two-venue product (Bybit, Hyperliquid), so its universe is the symbols listed on both. Bybit and Deribit were read in R6 and are both banned (see the table above); no route was withdrawn for them, by the same decision. R6 D3: peg-deviation no longer returns `latest.reference`. R6 D4: wallet-holdings no longer passes Helius's `price_usd`, `value_usd` or native `total_price`. **Superseded for Bybit and Deribit by R7 (above): both are out of every route.**

**Dropped in Phase C:**
- Coinbase, Kraken, Binance spot, OKX spot and Gemini, from every price route.
- Bybit spot, from market-state HYPE.
- The pegwatch Alpaca reference, from equity-24h.
- DexScreener, from every peg route's latest price and liquidity, and from equity-24h. pegwatch still records the token side from DexScreener; we read it only for window statistics before our cutover.
- Helius DAS (getAsset), the Helius enhanced transactions API, Helius getPriorityFeeEstimate and Jito tip_floor.

**Free routes:**
- /api/last-liquidation passes tape prints (raw-banned, C7).
- /api/fear-greed is clean, with attribution.
- /api/exit-method and /api/forecast-record are computed.
- /api/sample serves the stored captures. Since C5, OKX and Binance values and the Alpaca reference are null there, and so are the copies in the 402 challenges. R7 recaptured every route it changed. **/api/oi-spike-scan and /api/squeeze-score have no stored sample yet**: both answer 503 until the sampler is 24 hours deep (2026-10-14 03:51 UTC), and their samples are recaptured then (`node gen-bazaar-meta.js --recapture=get_oi_spike_scan,get_squeeze_score`); until the next restart their 402 challenges carry no output example.

### C7: the CEX liquidation tape stays, and its risk

- **What it is:** liqcollector.js stores every liquidation print from the public WebSocket streams of Bybit (API Terms §6.7, read in R6: no repackaging or reselling of Service Data), OKX and Binance (terms forbid redistribution: OKX API Agreement §9.4(a); Binance licence cl. 27 and the Vision dataset terms).
- **What is exposed raw:**
  - /api/liquidations and the free /api/last-liquidation return single prints (ts, symbol, exchange, side, size, price, usd);
  - nine routes return a single MAX or MIN print without naming the exchange.
- **What is computed:** every other tape output (sums, counts, splits, forecasts).
- **The risk:**
  - a venue could treat the raw prints as redistribution of its market data and ask us to stop;
  - the API Agreement terms allow suspension of access, which would end that venue's stream and blank its share of the tape.
  - No venue has contacted us.
- **Smallest change that removes the raw exposure, kept for a decision:** drop size, price and usd from individual prints, and replace the MAX/MIN print fields with bucketed or rounded aggregates. The tape keeps its value (cascade detection, forecasts and splits are all computed).
- **Decision of 12 Oct (planning chat):** keep the tape as is and record the risk here.

## Added in R5 Phase B (terms read 2026-10-12, before building)

Every source below was read before its route was built. Quotes are verbatim and short; the
page and its date are given so the next reader can re-check them.

| Source | Used by | Terms read | Clause (verbatim) | Raw / computed | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC EDGAR (www.sec.gov, data.sec.gov) | sec-filings, insider-trades, sec-8k | sec.gov "Accessing EDGAR Data" (26 Jun 2024); Webmaster FAQ (23 Aug 2024); Website Dissemination policy | "All Government-created content on sec.gov and EDGAR public filing content are free to access and reuse."; "may be copied or further distributed by users of the web site without the SEC's permission. Please consider appropriate citation to the SEC as the source."; "SEC" and "EDGAR" may not be used "in a trade name, trademark, or domain name"; "no more than 10 requests per second, regardless of the number of machines" | raw (filing metadata, Form 4 fields) | clean with citation: every response carries `source`; one box-wide token bucket at 8 req/s; declared User-Agent with a contact address; no route or product is named after SEC or EDGAR |
| Hyperliquid info API, HIP-3 dexes (api.hyperliquid.xyz) | tradfi-perps, fx-rates (HIP-3 marks) | app.hyperliquid.xyz/terms (15 Jun 2026) | the terms govern the Interface; the only HIP-3 wording is the disclaimer in 1.2 ("Markets ... created under permissionless deployment mechanisms ... are not reviewed, verified, or approved by the Company"); §3.1.8 bans automated use that would "exceed reasonable usage, bypass rate limits" | raw (mark, oracle, funding, OI of each market) | clean: one perpDexs read plus one metaAndAssetCtxs read per dex, cached 60 s (at most about 240 weight a minute against the 1,200 limit) |
| HIP-3 deployers: xyz (trade.xyz), flx (Felix), vntl (Ventuals), hyna (HyENA), km and mkts (Kinetiq), cash (dreamcash), para (Paragon), io (Entropy), abcd (ABCDEx) | tradfi-perps, fx-rates | each deployer's own terms, dated Jan to Sep 2026 | every set covers the deployer's own website or app and bans scraping it, e.g. trade.xyz bans "data mining, robots, scraping ... from the Interface"; Kinetiq and HyENA limit their platforms to "personal, non-commercial purposes"; dreamcash also covers "any other API or interface made available by SLL" | not called: their markets are read from HyperCore through api.hyperliquid.xyz only | clean as built: we never call a deployer's site or API. Responses label prices "each market's own HIP-3 oracle and mark price, not an exchange quote", and never as S&P, Nasdaq or NYSE prices. abcd has no assets and no site: moot |
| European Central Bank (data-api.ecb.europa.eu, EXR) | fx-rates | ecb.europa.eu "Disclaimer & copyright" (undated, Copyright 2026); FX reference rates page | "users of this website may make free use of the information ... the ECB must be cited as the source."; whoever sells it must inform buyers "both before they pay any subscription or fee and each time they access the information ... that the information may be obtained free of charge through this website."; modified information "must be stated explicitly"; "Using the rates for transaction purposes is strongly discouraged." | raw (rates as published, rounded to 6 decimals); computed crosses for other bases | clean with attribution and notice: the notice is in the route's description (shown in the 402 challenge, before payment) and in every response (`notice`); crosses are labelled in `rates_are`; the description says the rates are for information only |
| User-supplied web pages and PDFs (any public http/https URL) | web-markdown, pdf-markdown | RFC 9309 §1 (Sep 2022); EU DSM Directive 2019/790 Art. 4(3) | robots.txt rules "are not a form of access authorization"; the EU text-and-data-mining exception applies only where use "has not been expressly reserved ... such as machine-readable means" | the publisher's content, converted to markdown on one caller's request | clean as an on-request reader: honest User-Agent with our URL, robots.txt honoured for that agent (a disallowed path is a 400, never billed), no cookies, logins or paywall bypass, nothing stored (robots.txt is cached per origin for 1 h, page content never), SSRF guard (http/https, ports 80/443, every resolved address and every redirect checked, max 3), every response says the content belongs to its publisher (`rights`) |
| Libraries: @mozilla/readability 0.6.0, linkedom 0.18.13, turndown 7.2.4, unpdf 1.8.1, fast-xml-parser 5.11.2 | web-markdown, pdf-markdown, insider-trades | npm licence fields (read 12 Oct) | Apache-2.0, ISC, MIT, MIT, MIT | code, not data | clean; pinned exact, lockfile committed |
| GDELT DOC 2.0 (api.gdeltproject.org) | /api/news (NOT BUILT) | gdeltproject.org/about.html "Terms of Use" (undated) | "available for unlimited and unrestricted use for any academic, commercial, or governmental use of any kind without fee"; redistribution "must include a citation to the GDELT Project and a link" | — | terms clean with citation, but the API is not usable for a paid route: 4 of 4 reads answered 429 on 12 Oct (Mac and VPS, gaps of 8 s or more), and the retry at 19:30 UTC returned an empty 200 after 17 s, then 429 after a 10 s gap. B5 is not built; a paid route that 503s most of the time would never bill and would rank badly |

Routes in this section and the upstreams they reach (all clean, so none is in list A below):

| route | price | venues |

## Raw values by route (inventory of 12 Oct 2026, after the R4 deploy; superseded by the R5 Phase C table above)

A static read of the deployed tree: each route, the upstreams it reaches, and which response
fields carry an upstream value unchanged (rounded, unit-converted or renamed counts as raw)
versus values we compute. "raw?" marks a field whose provenance is ambiguous; the note says why.
The liquidation tape (liquidations.db, written by liqcollector.js) stores Bybit, OKX and
Binance prints verbatim; the peg tape (/opt/pegwatch) and the exit tape (/opt/overhang) are
collectors outside this repo.

### A. Routes passing a raw value from a BANNED or UNCLEAR venue

Shorthand: **tape-Bybit / tape-OKX / tape-Binance** means the liquidation tape rows from that venue's WebSocket. Where a tape field is a MAX or MIN over prints and the response does not name the exchange, the value can come from any of the three. That is why those routes get three rows.

|---|---|---|---|
| GET /api/cascade-forecast | $0.02 | Liquidation tape: Bybit (UNCLEAR), OKX (BANNED), Binance (BANNED). Read by the /opt/caliper library, outside the tree | `answers[].p`, `thresholdUsd` (the symbol's 90th-percentile 15-min total), `observed.usd/events/buyUsd/sellUsd` (window sums), `state`, `support`; `model.*`. The library is outside the tree, so whether it filters exchanges is unknown |
| GET /api/volatility | $0.01 | Bybit (UNCLEAR) daily klines | `realized_vol_7d_ann_pct`, `realized_vol_30d_ann_pct` (stdev of log returns), `today_range_pct` (high−low)/close |

| GET /api/forecast-record (FREE) | $0 | Liquidation tape, via caliper `record.db` (outside tree) | `summary` (tally), `rows[].thresholdUsd`, `p`, `observedUsd` (window sum), `outcome` |

### C. Routes with only CLEAN upstreams, or none

| route | price | upstream |
|---|---|---|
| GET /api/macro-calendar | $0.005 | federalreserve.gov (json/calendar.json and fomccalendars.htm), bls.gov (cpi.htm, empsit.htm), bea.gov (news/schedule), via bin/macro-collect.js (in tree) |
| GET /api/honeypot-check | $0.01 | mainnet.base.org and base.drpc.org (Base), bsc-dataseed(1).bnbchain.org (BSC), eth.drpc.org (Ethereum), plus our own baselaunches.db |
| GET /api/base-launches | $0.02 | base.drpc.org (logs) and mainnet.base.org (reads), via bin/base-launches-collect.js (in tree). `eth_usd` comes from an on-chain Uniswap V3 slot0 |
| GET /api/hl-whales | $0.02 | stats-data.hyperliquid.xyz (leaderboard), api.hyperliquid.xyz (clearinghouseState, metaAndAssetCtxs) |
| GET /api/fear-greed (FREE) | $0 | api.alternative.me. `value`, `classification` and `timestamp` are passed raw, with the `attribution` field present |

### Counts

**50 routes in A, 8 in B, 5 in C**, out of 63 routes: 59 paid plus 4 free. The free routes included are `/api/fear-greed` (C), `/api/last-liquidation` (A), `/api/exit-method` (B) and `/api/forecast-record` (B).

Two judgment calls shift these numbers:
- **8 routes are in A only because of MAX/MIN-selected single liquidation prints** (raw?): cascade, cascade-scan, liquidation-leaders, liquidation-stats, liq-history, liq-heatmap, cascade-history, venue-liq-share. If those selections count as computed, the split becomes **A=42, B=16, C=5**.
- **base-gas is in A only through its PublicNode fallback.** If fallback-only use is excluded, base-gas moves to C (A one lower, C one higher).

### Not counted

- **GET /api/sample and /api/sample/:route (free).** These serve the stored captures in `bazaar-examples.json` for all 59 paid routes, and those captures contain raw values from BANNED venues. Examples: the sol-price sample `price` with `source: coinbase`; the eth-price `quotes[]` from coinbase, kraken and binance; the equity-24h sample's Alpaca `last_regular_session`; the market-state sample's `open_interest.okx_usd`. The data is static, not live, but it is a raw copy served free.
- **POST /mcp.** This mirrors the same tool functions, plus MCP-only free tools: `get_cascade_forecast_free` (computed) and `get_forecast_question` (metadata). It inherits the classifications above.
- **Prose in the published descriptions.** Some route descriptions name venues that should not appear in them. The `PRICES.desc` of `/api/eth-price` still advertises "Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, OKX, Gemini", and the A2A agent card (`lib/compat.js:77`) still says "Bybit/OKX/Binance liquidation tape". Both match what the code actually fetches.

## R9 (14 Oct 2026): signal-board and coin-signal

Two routes for trading loops. Neither calls an upstream: every number is read from data this service already records, and
every answer names its sources and their `as_of` times (`data.sources`). No new venue, none from the banned or unclear list.

| route | price | sources | verdict | raw value still passed (venue) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| /api/signal-board | $0.01 | our Hyperliquid OI sampler (hl-oi.db, written every 5 min from Hyperliquid's public info API: mark, funding, open interest); our liquidation tape (Bybit, OKX, Binance prints) as hourly SUMS per symbol and a 7-day hourly median for the z-score; the top-250-accounts snapshot (Hyperliquid clearinghouse state, every 5 min) as per-coin net position | computed | — (no single liquidation print, no account address) |
| /api/coin-signal/:coin | $0.004 | the same three, plus our cascade forecast (caliper model over the tape) and the 24 h liquidation heatmap (price bands over the tape) | computed | — (heatmap bands are sums; whale positions are side, size, entry and liquidation price without addresses) |

- **Staleness (each gives 503 + Retry-After, never billed):** the OI sampler older than 15 minutes, the tape older than 30 minutes, the whale snapshot older than 15 minutes.
- **24 h fields** (price and OI change over a day) are null until the sampler holds a day of samples (it did from 14 Oct 03:51 UTC).
- **Universe:** the 178 Hyperliquid main-dex perps the sampler records (HIP-3 markets are not in the sampler).
- **The tape is a banned-or-unclear input on the CEX side (C7 above):** these two routes use it only as sums and as heatmap bands, like /api/liq-pulse and /api/squeeze-score, never a single print.

## R11 Phase A (13 Oct 2026): sources behind the new tool files (terms read before building)

Read on **2026-10-13**; the routes were wired on **14 Oct 2026** (R11). This table is what each route's source allows. "Line" is the clause that decides the verdict.

| source | route(s) | verdict | line | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OFAC SDN list, `sanctionslistservice.ofac.treas.gov/api/download/sdn.xml` | /api/sanctions-check/:address | **clean: accepted by the planning chat on 13 Oct 2026** | **Basis: the list is a US federal government work, which carries no copyright under 17 U.S.C. 105.** Treasury's "Site Policies and Notices" page (home.treasury.gov/subfooter/site-policies-and-notices) was read in full on 13 Oct: it lists required agency reports and **has no reuse clause, for or against.** The Sanctions List Service page offers the files for download with no terms. | The verdict rests on the federal-work rule, not on a published clause. The route serves exact matches only and says it is not legal advice. The download answers 302 to a signed S3 link on the Treasury's own bucket; the refresh follows it (treas.gov and amazonaws.com hosts only). |
| UK OFSI consolidated list (`ofsistorage.blob.core.windows.net/.../ConList.csv`, 16.6 MB) | none | **not used** | n/a | The CSV has no crypto-address column (16 hits for "wallet"/"crypto", all a surname or free text). Its licence (Open Government Licence) was not needed once the data was found unfit. |
| EU consolidated list (`webgate.ec.europa.eu/fsd/fsf/.../xmlFullSanctionsList_1_1`, 25.7 MB) | none | **not used** | n/a | **Only 72% of the file was read** (18.6 of 25.7 MB, the download timed out). In that part (4,449 entities) the only matches for "digital", "wallet" or "crypto" are job titles ("Ministry of Digital Development"). I have not seen a crypto-address field in this schema. Not proven for the unread 28%. |
| disposable-email-domains (github.com/disposable-email-domains/disposable-email-domains, `disposable_email_blocklist.conf`, 9,881 domains on 13 Oct) | /api/email-verify | **clean** | README, License: "You can copy, modify, distribute and use the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission." (CC0) | Refreshed weekly by `node tools/emailverify.js --refresh`. |
| DNS (node:dns against the box's resolver) | /api/email-verify, /api/domain/:domain | **clean** | public DNS protocol; no licence | |
| IANA RDAP bootstrap and registry RDAP servers (Verisign, PIR, Charleston Road Registry) | none | **dropped 13 Oct 2026 by the planning chat** | Verisign (and PIR in nearly the same words): the data may not be used to "enable high volume, automated, electronic processes that send queries or data to the systems of Verisign or an ICANN-accredited registrar". | Compliance with an automated-querying bar cannot be promised for a paid API, so /api/domain ships **DNS and TLS only**; there is no registrar, date or status field and the route makes no HTTP request. The code was removed, not switched off. |
| TLS handshake to the queried domain on port 443 | /api/domain/:domain | **clean** | a public TLS handshake; the certificate is public data | Private, loopback, link-local and metadata addresses are refused inside the socket's own lookup (same rule as lib/safe-fetch.js). |
| OpenAlex, `api.openalex.org` | /api/papers, /api/paper/:doi | **clean for the data; the API is metered, and the brief's numbers are out of date** | docs.openalex.org, API overview page: "all data is CC0 -- no license worries, ever". **Not as the brief said:** there is no 100,000-call day and no polite pool. Pricing (docs.openalex.org/access/pricing and example-costs, 13 Oct): every account gets **$1 of usage a day free**; **no key gets $0.10**; a search costs **$0.001** (1,000 a day on a free key, 100 keyless), a filtered list $0.0001, and **fetching one work by ID or DOI is free and unlimited**. | /api/paper/:doi works with no key at any volume. **Decision of 13 Oct: ship without a key.** Searches that reach OpenAlex are counted per UTC day; at 90 /api/papers answers 503 with Retry-After until 00:00 UTC, never billed (cache hits and DOI lookups are not counted). A free key is added later only if searches pass 50 a day (the cap then becomes 900). A 429 from OpenAlex also answers 503, unbilled. No `mailto` is sent: it no longer buys anything. Launch prices (14 Oct 2026): /api/papers $0.015, /api/paper/:doi $0.005; a search costs us $0.001 and a DOI lookup nothing. |
| Wikipedia REST and Action APIs, `<lang>.wikipedia.org` | /api/wiki | **clean with attribution and share-alike** | Wikimedia Terms of Use: content is shared "under free and open licenses"; text is CC BY-SA 4.0 (creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0). User-Agent policy: "Scripts should use an informative User-Agent string with contact information, or they may be blocked without notice." | Every answer carries the licence, its URL, the article URL, the history URL (authors) and the revision time. The UA is `AgentFeedBot/1.0 (https://x402.ochinimus.app; ...)`: a contact URL, no email. 24 h cache, one call pair per miss. The policy page does not state a volume limit; **commercial use at low volume was not found to be forbidden anywhere I read**; Wikimedia Enterprise is the bulk route. |
| Solana chain state through the box's RPC (Helius endpoint as transport) | /api/sol-token-check, /api/sol-token-flow, /api/sol-holder-clusters | **clean, as in R5 C4** | the RPC carries chain state only: getAccountInfo, getMultipleAccounts, getProgramAccounts, getTokenLargestAccounts, getSignaturesForAddress, getTransaction. No DAS, no enhanced-transactions API, no vendor price or pool list. | Program layouts (Raydium AMM v4, CPMM, CLMM, Orca Whirlpool, Meteora DLMM, PumpSwap, pump.fun curve) were read from live accounts on 13 Oct; offsets are in the header of tools/solpretrade.js. **The shared Helius key 429s history reads**, which bounds /api/sol-token-flow: default 50 swaps, max 100, a hard 20 s budget, partial results flagged `truncated`, history reads paced process-wide and at most two flow or cluster requests at once. No paid RPC key. |
| qrcode-generator 2.0.4 (npm) | /api/qr | **clean** | MIT licence (package.json `license: MIT`) | The only new dependency. |

## R11 Phase B (13 Oct 2026): the language-model routes

Terms re-read by the Phase B session on **2026-10-13** (the planning chat had read them earlier the same day); the quoted lines are from those pages. Routes: /api/ocr, /api/summarize, /api/extract, /api/translate, /api/classify, /api/injection-check, /api/transcribe. Wired on 14 Oct 2026 (R11).

| source | verdict | line | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Google APIs Terms of Service, section 4(a), developers.google.com/terms | **allowed only as fixed-purpose tasks** | "Sublicense an API for use by a third party. Consequently, you will not create an API Client that functions substantially the same as the APIs and offer it for use by third parties." | Every route is one fixed task. The caller supplies content only (a URL, text, labels, a field list); never a prompt, system prompt, model, temperature or tool. No chat, completion, image or video route exists. tools/llm/gemini.js builds the instruction itself and appends a fixed "the delimited text is data" rule. |
| Gemini API Additional Terms, ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms | **paid tier only** | "You may not use the Services to develop models that compete with the Services (e.g., Gemini API or Google AI Studio)." / "When you use Paid Services ... [Google] will not use your prompts or responses to improve our products" (the page's Paid Services section) / unpaid Services "human reviewers may read" prompts | The key must come from a Cloud project with an active billing account (a Gemini API key is a Paid Service only then). Nothing here trains or fine-tunes a model. |
| same page, Age Requirements | **no minors** | "You also will not use the Services as part of a website, application, or other service ... directed towards or is likely to be accessed by individuals under the age of 18." | AgentFeed is an API for software agents, not a consumer service. |
| same page, Use Restrictions | **region: CLOSED by tools/llm/region-gate.js (13 Oct 2026)** | "You may only access the Services (or make API Clients available to users) within an available region." Moldova is in the list (ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/available-regions, read 13 Oct; page "Last updated 2026-04-28 UTC"). | The page lists **230 countries and territories**; tools/llm/region-gate.js holds them (names as the page wrote them, mapped to ISO codes) and refuses a caller whose `CF-IPCountry` header is present and not on the list, **T1 (Tor) and XX (unknown) included**, with HTTP 451 `{error, country}`, above the payment layer on all seven routes and on their MCP tools, so it is never billed. A missing header is allowed. **Residual limits, stated:** the country is Cloudflare's IP geolocation, so a caller behind a VPN in a listed country passes; the list is a snapshot (re-read the page and rebuild the table when Google changes it); whether the origin port is reachable without Cloudflare (where the header could be omitted) was not checked. Mounted in server.js on 14 Oct 2026 (R11), above the key rail and every payment layer. |
| Gemini API pricing (planning chat, 13 Oct) | **cost table** | gemini-3.1-flash-lite $0.25 in / $0.50 audio in / $1.50 out per 1M tokens; gemini-3.5-flash-lite $0.30 / $0.30 / $2.50 | In tools/llm/gemini.js. Thinking tokens bill as output, so every call asks for thinkingLevel MINIMAL. |
| Model IDs | **verified against the live list, 13 and 14 Oct 2026** | ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models lists gemini-3.1-flash-lite and gemini-3.5-flash-lite without "preview" | `verifyModels()` in tools/llm/gemini.js, run on the box with the key on 14 Oct: both IDs listed, neither a preview. Both accept thinkingLevel MINIMAL (13 Oct keycheck). |
| The fetched content (the page, PDF, image or audio at a caller's URL) | as for /api/web-markdown | fetched once on request through lib/safe-fetch.js, robots.txt honoured, not stored; the content stays its publisher's | Only the model's derived answer is kept, in a 24 h in-memory cache keyed by content hash. Text sent to Gemini is the page's own text. |

## Payment infrastructure (not data sources)

CDP facilitator (x402 exact on Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, Solana and World Chain; batch-settlement on Base, Polygon,
Arbitrum, R5), Circle Facilitator Service (Arc), Circle Gateway (nanopayments on Base, Polygon,
Arbitrum, Arc, R5), GoPlausible (Algorand, R5), Ultravioleta (Optimism, Monad, Avalanche in every 402; Celo, HyperEVM,
Unichain, Scroll, SKALE Base, BNB Chain, Ethereum and Robinhood Chain on request, R10), PayAI (Sei and X Layer on request, R10),
Tempo RPC (MPP tempo/charge), Helius (MPP solana/charge verification). Their terms govern
settlement, not data resale, and are out of scope here.

### Prepaid keys (R9, 14 Oct 2026)

Not a data source and not a new payment protocol: a key is a balance stored in agentfeed.db (`api_keys`, only the sha256 of the key), bought with one ordinary x402 payment on the exact rails and spent per call at the route's high-frequency price (half the x402 price, minimum $0.0005). The purchase routes (`/api/keys/buy-trial`, `buy-1`, `buy-5`, `buy-20`, `topup-5`, `topup-20`) carry no batch-settlement and no Gateway accept, so credit cannot be bought at half price. Revenue is the settled purchase (status `paid`); the calls it funds are rows of status `key` and are never added to revenue. Credit is non-refundable and has no expiry (terms at /terms).

### Batch-settlement in operation (R8, 13 Oct 2026; measured on Base, planning chat decision the same day)

- **Two CDP steps, claim then settle.** `ops/batch-claim.js` claims the vouchers (channel balance to the receiver's claimed bucket) and then
  settles the bucket to the treasury; it waits for the claim to show on-chain before settling, because CDP answers a claim before it is
  mined and a settle sent in between is refused as `amount_too_low`. CDP's error table names `amount_too_low` and publishes no number.
- **CDP's claim minimum lies in (0.0005, 0.0010] USDC.** Measured on 13 Oct: a claim of 0.0005 was refused three times, a claim of 0.0010
  went through twice, and both settles of 0.0010 were accepted (tx hashes in AF-R8-report-20261013.md). Vouchers come in multiples of
  0.0005, so a claim needs 0.001 owed.
- **Exposure, accepted.** The batch price is half the list price with a floor of $0.0005 (`lib/hf.js`). Only the **four routes listed at
  $0.001 (sol-price, btc-price, eth-price, spot)** have a batch price below the minimum; on every other route each voucher is claimable on
  its own (fx-rates, at $0.002, is exactly 0.001). On those four a channel can be left holding **at most one 0.0005 voucher** that
  cannot be claimed until another is added; a payer who then starts the timed withdrawal (24 h delay, `withdrawDelay` 86400 s) can take
  that 0.0005 back. Claimed value is the receiver's and cannot be withdrawn; unclaimed vouchers are at risk only through
  `initiateWithdraw`, the delay and `finalizeWithdraw`. **Decision (planning chat, 13 Oct 2026): no $0.001 floor on the batch tier**, and a
  higher minimum deposit would not change this (it bounds a channel's total, not what is left under CDP's threshold). The claim job
  records what CDP refused per channel and the watchdog stays quiet at or below it (state file `networks.<net>.claim_refused_atomic`).
  What would reopen the decision: dust channels (each opens with a deposit transaction that counts against the CDP free tier).
- **A client that lost its channel context meets one corrective 402, never a failure.** The server checks a voucher against one number,
  the channel's `chargedCumulativeAmount`; a claim changes `totalClaimed` and never that number, and the channel store updates inside
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, so the claim cron and the server cannot desync a channel (proved by `test/batch-resync.test.js`: one client context
  paying through claim runs from a second process, zero corrective 402s; a positive control that rewinds the charged total fails it). A
  client with no stored context (a fresh process per call) rebuilds its base from the chain's claimed total, which is behind the
  server's charged total whenever vouchers are outstanding; the server answers `invalid_batch_settlement_evm_cumulative_amount_mismatch`
  with its state and its signed voucher, the standard client resyncs and retries inside the same `fetch()`, and the buyer gets a 200.
  Those 402s are logged as `payment_refused` rows (13 Oct 06:41 UTC: ids 11994 and 11997, calls 2 and 4 of the top-up, the two calls that
  began with a 0.0005 voucher that CDP would not claim); `ops/af-digest.js` counts them on their own line and neither lists the buyer as
  failed nor alerts on them. A buyer who keeps its channel context in a long-lived process never sees one.
