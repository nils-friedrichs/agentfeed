// tools/prices.js — SOL/USD and BTC/USD spot, multi-source with ordered fallback.
//
// WHY THIS IS NO LONGER PYTH-ONLY. On 2026-08-27 hermes.pyth.network began
// answering 401 "unauthorized" to unauthenticated callers. It had been the
// single source here since July, so every route that touches getPrice went 502
// at once: the PAID /api/sol-price and /api/btc-price, market-snapshot,
// trade-context, the MCP price tools, and the telegraph mirror of all of them.
// A single free upstream with no fallback is a single point of failure for a
// paid product, and this file is the fix for that, not just for Pyth.
//
// THE ORDER IS DELIBERATE. Coinbase and Kraken are keyless, unmetered and were
// both verified answering 200 at the time of writing. Pyth stays LAST rather
// than being deleted, so that if public access is restored the oracle - which
// is the only one of the three that publishes a confidence interval - starts
// serving again on its own with no code change.
//
// FIRST FINITE NUMBER WINS. A source that answers non-200, throws, or parses to
// something that is not a finite number is skipped and the next is tried. If
// EVERY source fails, this throws and the caller returns 502. That is correct:
// it is a real outage. Nothing here invents a price, and nothing here serves a
// cached price past its TTL without the caller being told by the error.
//
// RETURN SHAPE IS FROZEN. Callers include the paid routes, market-snapshot,
// trade-context, mcp.js and the answer.js price shaper. The keys are exactly
//   { symbol, price, confidence, publish_time, source }
// and they do not change with the source. confidence and publish_time are
// NULL for venues that do not publish them - Coinbase and Kraken return a spot
// price and nothing else. Null is the honest value: fabricating a confidence
// interval would be inventing precision the venue never stated, and a made-up
// number is worse than an absent one. `source` names who actually served.

// Pyth Hermes was dropped from getPrice on 2026-10-12: it needs a paid data plan since
// Jul 31 2026 (401 keyless) and its terms forbid re-serving raw prices as a machine-readable
// feed. The feed ids stay as the list of supported symbols.
