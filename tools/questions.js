// This used to sit in tools/discovery.js, which made it SKILL.md's private
// property. payments.js now leads every paid route's 402 challenge description
// with the same sentence, and CDP curates on that description, so the two must
// be the same string by construction rather than by somebody remembering. One
// module, two readers: if this file is the only source, they cannot drift.

// Prose, not numbers: nothing here goes stale when a price or a count changes.

// The question a caller actually has, per route. Prose, not numbers: nothing
// here can go stale when a price or a count changes. A route missing from this
// map falls back to its own description, so a new route is never dropped from
// the table -- it just gets a rougher question until someone writes one.
