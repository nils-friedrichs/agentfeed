// tools/overhang.js — exit-liquidity measurements from the overhang collector's tape.
//
// WHAT THIS SELLS. A lending protocol marks collateral at an oracle price. A liquidator
// only acts if the liquidation bonus it earns beats what it costs to actually get out of
// that collateral. overhang quotes real sell clips into USDC against live routing and
// compares the proceeds with the marked value, so the number returned here is what a
// seizer would actually realise, not what the protocol says the collateral is worth.
//
// READONLY, DELIBERATELY. The tape is written by a cron collector every 15 minutes.
// This paid read path must never be able to write to its own evidence, so the handle is
// opened exactly as tools/liquidations.js opens the liquidation tape.
