//
// Every route used to declare declareDiscoveryExtension({}), which publishes an
// EMPTY input shape and no output at all. Measured 2026-09-25 against CDP:
// all 20 of AgentFeed's indexed routes showed `queryParams: {}` and none had
// `info.output`, while 14,750 of the Bazaar's 17,422 listings carried an output
// example; CDP's own validator returned an advisory FAIL on bazaar.info.output
// for every route tested. x402scan/AgentCash marks a route with no input schema
// non-invocable outright.
//
// The declarations are GENERATED, never hand-written: gen-bazaar-meta.js derives
// the input schema from each route's own zod schema (expansion.js EXP, mcp.js
// TOOL_DEFS) and captures the output example by calling the same function the
// route calls, then writes bazaar-examples.json. Re-run it when a route's shape
// changes; a route missing from that file is named loudly at boot below.
//
// LOADED DEFENSIVELY. This file is the payment layer of the live revenue
// service. A missing or corrupt metadata file must degrade to the old empty
// declaration -- which is exactly what shipped until today -- and never stop the
// paid surface from serving.

// --- x402 challenge description bound -------------------------------------
//
// MEASURED 2026-09-01 by A/B/A against the live CDP facilitator, bisected over
// seven redeploys on get_cascade_forecast:
//
//     desc 487 chars (challenge header 2268 B) -> settles
//     desc 515 chars (challenge header 2308 B) -> facilitator /verify 400,
//                                                 relayed to the client as 402
//
// A description past the bound makes the endpoint UNPAYABLE. The facilitator
// rejects the paymentPayload, this server relays that as a fresh 402, and the
// route's own handler is never reached. It is invisible from curl, which only
// ever sees a correct-looking challenge, and it cost get_cascade_forecast every
// sale it might have made.
//
// The bound is closed HERE, at the payment boundary, and nowhere else. `desc`
// in the pricing table stays whole: GET /, /.well-known/x402.json, the landing
// page and the MCP tool definitions all render the full text, because that is
// what humans and LLM tool-selection read. Only the 402 challenge is trimmed.
//
// 400 is 87 chars under the measured-good 487 and 115 under the known-bad 515,
// so a longer route path or extra tags -- which also count toward the payload --
// cannot push a route over. It was 256 until CDP's curation bar required the
// description to say WHEN to use the endpoint: the when-to-use sentence is
// prepended, which costs 18-62 chars, and at 256 that was silently eating the
// tail of 29 of the 52 routes. At 400 exactly 4 are trimmed. The trim only ever
// costs the tail: the route's opening and its when-to-use question come first,
// and the deploy gate refuses a build where those two alone would not fit.

 * The challenge description: the route's own noun phrase first, then when to

 *
 * CDP's curation bar (docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/seller/get-discovered) asks for
 * "a description that tells an agent WHEN to use the endpoint". 3571ce9 answered
 * that by putting "Use when you need to answer: <question>" FIRST on every route.
 * MEASURED 2026-09-28: after /api/funding-rate's index picked up that text,
 * "funding rate perps" fell from #3 to #4 (stable over four samples), "funding
 * rate" rose #5 -> #4 and "funding rates perps" held #7. CDP's search is hybrid
 * and weights the opening, so the question now goes SECOND and each route leads
 * with its own keywords again -- "perp market data" returned AgentFeed nowhere
 * while every result it did return opened with those words.
 *
 * Built, not written: the opening is the description's first sentence and the
 * question is tools/questions.js -- the same map SKILL.md renders.
