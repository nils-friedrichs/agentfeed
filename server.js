// every paid handler unmetered (856 crawler probes since 2026-07-21, all one
// GCP IP). Still verb-exact in @x402/core 2.21.0 (checked 2026-09-15), so a
// dependency bump alone would not close it.
//
// A HEAD on a PAID route is answered with the 402 challenge (since 2026-10-08;
// 405 before). x402 v2 carries the whole challenge in the PAYMENT-REQUIRED
// header, so a bodiless answer still quotes, and a crawler that probes with
// HEAD sees a priced route instead of a dead one. It is done by handing the
// request to the x402 layer as a GET with every payment header removed: with
// nothing presented the layer can only answer its plain challenge, so a HEAD
// can never settle and never reach a handler. Node drops the body by itself,
// because it decided the response has none when the request arrived as HEAD.
// A HEAD on a free /api route is answered like a GET with no body (R10 F7):
// Express runs the app.get handler for HEAD and Node drops the body, so the
// status and headers are the GET's. It answered 405 until 2026-10-14, and 56
// HEADs from directory and liveness checkers (agentexchange-bazaar,
// hermes-contact-discovery, browsers) read that as a dead route. Such a HEAD is
// metered with GET (the limiter above), because it does run the handler.
// Matches /api/* only: /health, / and /.well-known are untouched.
// R19a (21 Oct 2026): "priced" and "under /api/" are decided on the CANONICAL path (lib/canon-path.js: case-insensitive, // collapsed, trailing / stripped,
// the rules @x402/core routes by), never on the spelling. This guard used an exact, case-sensitive regex while Express routes case-insensitively and
// with an optional trailing slash and the x402 gate only matches GET, so HEAD /API/<route> and HEAD /api/<route>/ reached the PAID handler with no
// payment: Content-Length and ETag of the paid answer went out (the paid answer for a route with few possible answers), the handler's upstream calls ran
// on our money, and a `free` row was written for a priced tool. Now EVERY HEAD under /api/ is handed on as a GET with the payment headers removed,

// braces: the zone 308s http to https, so X-Forwarded-Proto is already https.
