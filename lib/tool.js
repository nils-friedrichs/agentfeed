  //
  // `paid` used to be the process-wide `paymentsOn` flag, so every response said
  // paid:true whenever the x402 layer was mounted at all -- including the free
  // tasters. A judge following the README's "try it free" line ran
  // `curl /api/fear-greed` and was told it had paid for it.
  //
  // The honest answer is "is this route priced": a 200 on a priced route can only
  // happen after the x402 middleware or the MPP gate accepted payment, because
  // both sit in front of the handler and neither lets an unpaid request through.
  // An unpriced route was never charged for.
  //
  // KEYED ON PRICES, NOT ON priceUsd. get_fear_greed is registered as
  // tool('get_fear_greed', 0.001, ...) but is deliberately absent from PRICES --
  // free routes are kept out so the x402 middleware never sees a $0 route -- so
  // the price argument is not evidence of anything. PRICES is the paywall's own
  // table and is the only thing that decides.
  //
  // `req.route.path` is the registered pattern, not the requested URL, so
  // /api/token-risk/<mint> yields '/api/token-risk/:mint' and matches the PRICES
  // key exactly. That holds for expansion.js routes too: register() does
  // app.get(t.route.replace('GET ', ''), ...) while PRICES_ADD is keyed on
  // t.route, so the two are the same string by construction. Verified against
  // the live tree: 17 routes here + 34 from expansion.js, 48 of which are in
  // PRICES and 3 of which are not -- exactly the three published at / as
  // free_tools.
  //
  // NOT read from the settlement header: @x402/express writes that AFTER the
  // response, so at res.json() time it does not exist yet. The audit row in
  // res.on('finish') still reads the real settlement and is untouched.
