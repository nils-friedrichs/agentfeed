// lib/ratelimit.js — the per-address request limiter (server.js mounts it once, right after keys.identify).
//
// Fixed one-minute window, keyed on CF-Connecting-IP. Cloudflare sets it from the connection it terminated, a caller cannot
// forge it through the edge, and it is the only address header that survives the tunnel (measured on this box: x-forwarded-for
// is APPENDED to what the caller sent, so its leftmost element is attacker-controlled; x-real-ip is absent). The fallback is the
// raw socket peer, never req.ip, which `trust proxy` derives from X-Forwarded-For.
//
// FOUR BUCKETS, because a registry prober is not a customer and a 783 KB document is not a 405.
//
//   metered  240/min  GET and POST /mcp (and HEAD on a free /api route, which runs that route's handler): everything that costs
//                     us work, free data routes and requests that carry a payment included. Raised from 60 because one
//                     `pay catalog check` probe is one request per manifest route and two probes in a minute tripped the old limit.
//   other   2400/min  HEAD/OPTIONS/PUT/PATCH/DELETE: answered before any handler (x402scan's verb sweep of 2026-09-25 had tripped
//                     the shared bucket and left 22 of 52 paid routes unregistered).
//   docs     120/min  GET /openapi.json, /llms.txt, /SKILL.md, /.well-known/x402* and (R15b) their aliases and the other /.well-known files: prebuilt documents (the biggest, x402.json, is
//                     783 KB; openapi.json 580 KB). Their own bucket so a sweep of the paid routes cannot starve them (15 Oct 2026:
//                     x402scan's `agentcash register` was answered 429 on /openapi.json at 18:22:58 and 18:24:46 UTC, and the same on
//                     Oct 14 for two more AWS addresses, because its 90-route sweep had already used the shared 240) and, the other
//                     way round, so a document flood cannot spend more bandwidth than before: 120 x 783 KB is under the 240 x 783 KB
//                     the shared bucket allowed. A registration fetches a handful of documents; 120 is 20 or more registrations a minute.
//   unpaid  1200/min  GET on a priced path with no payment header, no key and no MPP credential. Nothing runs but the x402 layer's
//                     plain challenge (a 2 KB body and an 11 KB PAYMENT-REQUIRED header), so it costs what a HEAD costs and sits
//                     between the 'metered' and 'other' limits. 1,200 is 3.3 sweeps of all 90 priced routes at the 4 unpaid GETs per
//                     route per day the heaviest registry prober was recorded making (unpaid_402, 360 for 90 routes), which covers a
//                     failed run and its retry plus a `pay catalog check` in the same minute. Requests that carry a payment, and the
//                     free data routes, stay on 'metered'.
//
// Retry-After on every 429, and one logged row per bucket per address per window (a flood must not become a write storm); the
// row reuses status bad_request, which this table's readers (afwatch, the solwatch MCP x402_revenue tool) already know.
